# Easy Profile library

> WIP: This library is under development. The API and features may change in future releases.

The `Profile` class encapsulates the configuration and state for a user or application profile. It manages profile-specific settings, such as name, parameters, and other customizable options.

## Example usage

Detailed documentation for both implementations can be found in the `any/` and `strong/` directories.
Usage examples are provided in the `src/any.h` and `src/strong.h` files.
